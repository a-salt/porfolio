                        <br><h2>Project Overview</h2>
                        <p>The Congo Tree is a youth development charity based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the UK. They equip young people in DRC with transferable life and leadership skills, support them with mentoring and encourage them to get involved in their community.
                           <br><br>Their main goal was to have a fresher look and improved functionality, particularly with the addition of a drop down menu and a toggle button to swap between the English and French language. I worked in a team with two other UX designers to deliver an initial design.</p>
                        <h2>Identifying the problem</h2>
                        <p>We used user research to learn more about pain points users faced when using TCT’s existing website. During user testing, we discovered that users were confused about the information they were seeing on the website, and unable to use it on a mobile device.<br>Their main goal was to have a fresher look and improved functionality, particularly with the addition of a drop down menu and a toggle button to swap between the English and French language. I worked in a team with two other UX designers to deliver an initial design.
                            <br><br>Therefore, we planned to improve information architecture, navigation and create a responsive web design (RWD) solution. Our redesign of the Congo Tree website aimed to achieve greater user engagement and allow the non-profit to share its values and goals with more users.</p>
